## Plans For Repository

As this is a repository based on the learning progress of [*TS**](#ts-typescript), i don't plan on updating it in the future unless future updates on the language occur.

However, it can act as a memory bank for anyone, myself included, who wants to refresh their knowledge on the concept of the language.

## Project setup

The project is public and can be cloned by anyone, but aside from the first commit which occurs on the **main** branch, the other concepts of the language may be found in subsequent branches, that is if there are different concepts, as shown below:

>|   Branches    |  Commits  |
>|:------------: |---------: |
>| **Branch 1**  | Commit 1  |
>| **Branch 2**  | Commit 2  |
